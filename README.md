# bashBibleScripting

Useage: Repository for placing scripts generated from utilizing "Linux Command Line and Shell Scripting Bible" by Blum and Bresnahan and "Cybersecurity Ops with Bash."

I will be utilizing this repository for a Spring 2020 independent study course teaching students about Linux and Bash. The code in this repo is being completed and checked for errors prior to the start of the semester as I've never personally used these two sources.
